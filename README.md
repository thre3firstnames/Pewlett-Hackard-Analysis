# Employee Database Analysis for Pewlett Hackard using SQL
## Overview
Provide PH with datasets built from their employee records that illustrate the number of current employees reaching retirement age. Then, assemble the data for a list of current, eligible employees for participation in an upcoming mentorship program.

## Results
 Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- According to the data resulting from our examination of retiring employees, almost 25% of PH’s current workforce will be retiring soon. This is a staggering number even against PH’s large current employee total – **72,458 employees out of 300,024**.
- Illustrated by the output pictured below, a majority (**70%**) of retiring employees hold *Senior* positions within PH.

- In addition to the above observation, the number of managers among this generation is less than half of the total number of managers across PH. Interestingly, very few of those employees chose/were chosen to move up to managerial roles. 
- We have no employee data (or, perhaps, none exists) for any hirings after January of 2000. This forces me to believe that we have only half of the whole picture. I find it odd that PH chose to exclude this data–its omission has likely skewed our analysis. 

## Summary
- The greatest need in light of the *silver tsunami* would be for the **50,842** Senior Engineer and Senior Staff member positions to be filled; these positions will need to be backfilled before all others. The non-senior Engineer and Staff positions are somewhat less worrying, as the majority of those positions are filled by employees outside the retirement scope.
- Unfortunately, there are not enough employees slated to participate in the mentorship program to cope with the upcoming losses. If serious work toward promoting current employees were to begin immediately, and the mentorship eligibility pool were widened to include those employees who will soon retire (rather than the slightly younger generation within it now), it might be possible to offset the looming crisis of an undereducated workforce.

- Digging deeper into the departmental splits of the current employees approaching retirement should provide further insight into which departments need special support. At least two additional tables will need to be created for this analysis–one for retiring employees by department and one for non-retiring employees by department. 
- Examining generational gaps in department managers would also be valuable. Perhaps the time is right to create several more subordinate positions at the managerial level – these individuals could even be among those in the mentorship eligibility group. Departments at PH are quite large, and it’s likely a daunting task for one person. Creating a table for the total employees within each department might make it clear how many people should be supporting those large teams in the face ever-evolving workplace expectations.
